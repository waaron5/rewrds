rewrds is a personal project I built to help people like me find the best credit cards for their lifestyle.

The world of credit cards is messy — full of bias, gimmicks, and hidden incentives. Sites like The Points Guy, NerdWallet, and Bankrate are helpful, but they’re also incentivized to promote certain cards.

rewrds cuts through that noise. It’s a data-driven, unbiased quiz powered by a growing database of cards and refined scoring logic — designed to give honest, personalized recommendations in minutes.

No ads. No affiliate pushes. No endless research or YouTube deep dives.
Just clear, data-backed answers — take the quiz and see for yourself.

Sites like The Points Guy, Nerdwallet, and Bankrate are great, but they are incentivized to rank and recommend financial products that they are paid to promote. 

rewrds is different - it's a place where anyone can contribute to and benefit from a community driven platform built on transparent informaiton, honesty, and real user expereinces.

No sponsored results.
No corporate bias.
Just straight-up insights from people - not advertisers. -->
